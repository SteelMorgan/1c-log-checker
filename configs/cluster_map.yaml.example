# Cluster and Infobase GUID Mapping
# This file maps GUIDs to human-readable names for better readability in logs and UI

clusters:
  # Example cluster
  # "you cluster guid":
  #   name: "cluster name here"
  #   notes: "any your notes"

infobases:
  # Example infobase
  # "your base guid":
  #   name: "your banse name"
  #   cluster_guid: "you cluster guid"
  #  notes: "any notes about base"

# How to get GUIDs:
# 1. Using rac.exe (1C:Enterprise Administration Console):
#    rac.exe cluster list
#    rac.exe infobase summary --cluster <cluster-guid> --infobase <infobase-guid>
#
# 2. For file-based infobases:
#    Check the 1Cv8Log directory name in your infobase folder
#
# 3. See docs/guides/get-guids.md for detailed instructions
