# План проекта

## Phase 1: Research & Planning
- [x] Document findings and create detailed implementation plan

## Phase 2: Development/Implementation
- [ ] Phase 2.1: ClusterGUID/InfobaseGUID extraction - implement mapping through MCP parameters
- [ ] Phase 2.2: Format detection - read from logcfg.xml with fallback
- [ ] Phase 2.3: offset tracking - implement BoltDB storage for techlog offsets
- [ ] Phase 2.4: Timestamp extraction from filename for hierarchical format
- [ ] Phase 2.5: Historical file processing on first run
- [ ] Phase 2.6: Performance metrics - measure parsing time, file count, record count

## Phase 3: Testing
- [ ] Phase 3.1: Testing - Create techlog config via configure_techlog MCP tool
- [ ] Phase 3.2: Testing - Generate logs via unit tests (following skill workflow)
- [ ] Phase 3.3: Testing - User verification of config and generated logs
- [ ] Phase 3.4: Testing - Debug parser with generated logs
- [ ] Phase 3.5: Testing - Verify disable_techlog MCP tool
- [ ] Phase 3.6: Testing - Verify get_tech_log MCP tool and data retrieval
- [ ] Phase 3.7: Testing - Final verification of complete workflow
